# 🛡️ ThreatNexus AI

> **AI-Powered Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard** built using **Flask**, **Python**, **Plotly**, **SQLite**, and **VirusTotal API** to visualize cyber threats, perform IOC lookups, analyze attack patterns, and generate security reports.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

ThreatNexus AI is a web-based Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) dashboard that simulates a modern Security Operations Center (SOC). The application provides interactive dashboards, threat analytics, IOC (Indicator of Compromise) lookup using the VirusTotal API, live threat monitoring, and downloadable reports.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of cybersecurity concepts, data visualization, API integration, and Flask web development.
